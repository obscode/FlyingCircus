This repository contains jupyter notebooks used for the introductory python sessions
held each summer for the [Carnegie Astrophysics Summer Student Internship (CASSI)](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/CASSI) program.

The notebooks make reference to the data files that are also located in this repository.
Along with the two primary notebooks (IntroToPython and Visualization), 
there are also some extra notebooks that showcase more advanced topics, including:

 - Vectorizing code
 - Debugging
 - Model fitting
 - Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. 
 
These are located in the MoreNotebooks folder.

To download this repository to your computer, run:

```   git clone https://github.com/obscode/FlyingCircus.git```
   
This will create a folder (`FlyingCircus`). Change to this folder and run the `jupyter` notebook viewer:

```   jupyter-notebook```
   
You should now get a browser from which you can select and launch the various `ipython` notebook files (`*.ipynb`).
