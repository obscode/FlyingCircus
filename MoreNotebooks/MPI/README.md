# MPI for Python

This notebook is in a special location because it requires quite a bit
of setup to get MPI working on a laptop, so not appropriate for the 
Python Flying Circus. If you are interested in using MPI, then it is 
best to install this repository on an HPC computing platform that already
has MPI installed already.
