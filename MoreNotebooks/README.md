# Extra Notebooks

In this folder you'll find more example notebooks that we've put together.
Here is a brief synopsis of each:

* AstropySmorgasbord.ipynb: A notebook that shows all kinds of useful
  astro-related tasks using the astropy package.

* BuggyPrograms.ipynb:  A good deal of time is spent debugging. Here's some
  code that has common mistakes. Try to find them all!

* JupyterToCommandLine.ipynb:  How to take your favorite jupyter notebooks and
  convert them to stand-alone scripts, which may be more useful for HPC
  computing.

* MPI_parallel.ipynb:  How to work with parallel processing in python, a powerful
  way to reduce run-time of certain kinds of algorithms on HPC resources.

* ModelFitting:  A folder with 3 notebooks that demonstrate fitting models in
  various ways.
  
* PlottingWithStyle.ipynb:  The defaults for matplotlib are not great of
  publication-quality graphs. Here's how to make your plots look better.

* Plotting_Interactive.ipynb: A powerful tool in visualization is the ability
  to interactively change your plot. This notebook shows the basics of making
  interactive plots.

* Skyfit.ipynb: fit real data of sky background levels and try to model the 
  contribution from the moon. Uses scipy to fit the model, astropy to compute
  lots of celestial coordinates, and bokeh to visualize the multi-dimensional,
  complex data set. A good case-study of how python "brings it all together."

* Vectorizing.ipynb:  Here you'll find some tips/tricks for making your
  python code more efficient.
